# Time-series-forecasting-of-energy-generation-data
## Objective 1: 
To Analyze the past energy generation data to deduce a trend and predict the amount of energy that will be generated by the wind turbine generator by implementing Random Forest!
## Objective 2: 
Use the past data collected from the wind turbine generators to forecast the undesirable breakdowns due to various factors by using Random Forest
## Objective 3:
Combine and convert multiple data sets with different data formats to a single unified SQL database for the ease of analyzing and forecasting!
## Objective 4:
Create an Energy Dashboard using Power BI to display the forecasted energy and break down data.

## Steps executed:

## Results:
Energy generation forecast accuracy: 42-85% approx. (varies according to location, weather and turbines)
Breakdown forecast Accuracy: 80-90% (varies according to factors and turbines).
